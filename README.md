This C++ program helps students calculate their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on their exam results. 
Users simply enter the number of courses theyâ€™ve taken, along with the grades and credit hours for each. 
The program then calculates their total grade points, semester GPA, and final CGPA, making it easier to track academic performance.
